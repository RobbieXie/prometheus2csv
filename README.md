# prometheus2csv
This is a tool to query multiple metrics from a prometheus database through the REST API, and save them into a csv file.  initial version forked https://github.com/gluckzhang/prometheus2csv

## Why do we need this?
Needless to say, we have lots of requirements towards docker monitoring. And what's more, we want to dig into metrics exporting methods. In order to do some data analysis, we want to extract metrics in a usable/simple format (e.g. CSV). It's easy to query some metrics, but the tools paid less attention to export multiple metrics joined by timestamp(this can be some scenarios about data analysis, or dev daily report), then prometheus2csv was born. More info about 2 basic docker monitoring solutions, you can visit my blog [here](http://blog.gluckzhang.com/archives/145/).

## How to use it?
`prometheus2csv` is a command line tool for Python 3. Basic useage is as follows:

```bash
python prometheus2csv.py -h http://prometheus:9090 -c blc_server -o test.csv -s 10s --period=120
```

`http://prometheus:9090` is your Prometheus server's address, `blc_server` is the name of the container which you want to query multiple metrics, `test.csv` is the target csv file's name(default is result.csv), `10s` indicates query resolution step width in Prometheus query API, `120` means that you will get 120 **minutes** data which is in the most recent period.

### All arguments of prometheus2csv

Required arguments:

- -h / --host: Prometheus server address
- -c / --container: The name of the container which you want to query multiple metrics

Optional arguments:

- -o / --outfile: Query result's CSV filename, default is `result.csv`
- -s / --step: Query resolution step width in Prometheus query API, default is `10s`
- --period: Indicate this to get most recent period's data, it's an integer, in minute. For example, when you use `--period=120`, you will get the data from 120 mins ago till now
- --start: Start time in the query, use timestamp or rfc3339
- --end: End time in the query, use timestamp or rfc3339
- --help: Get the basic help info

*Attention: you can use start&end OR period to query data, if these 3 arguments all exist, `period` will be the priority.*

## Ideal data format

```
-------------------------------------------------
| timestame + metric1 + metric2 + metric3 + ... |
-------------------------------------------------
| xxxxxxxxx + value1  + value2  + value3  + ... |
-------------------------------------------------
| ...       + ...     + ...     + ...     + ... |
-------------------------------------------------
```

## Implementation details

Mainly use [Prometheus HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries) to get the result (query and query_range).

### Step1: Get all the metric names based on the container's name

It's a little tricky here, because Prometheus doesn't provide any query functions to get this info, but we can query like this:

```
http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum by(__name__)({name="blc_server"})
```

Then you will get all the metrics' names(get them by `__name__`) relevant to container 'blc_server'. Hence `timestamp + these_metrics_names` will be our csv file's header.

### Step2: Query every metric's values and join them together by timestamp

Construct series of query urls based on the names of metrics, then we can get timestamp-value info for every metric. Use a dictionary to store these data, timestamp can be keys and each key corresponds to a list.

*As far as I know, Prometheus doesn't provide such method to get multiple metrics' values joined by timestamp, so we have to make series of queries as well. Sometimes you can get similar csv file in Grafana, this is an end-user method talked in [my blog](http://blog.gluckzhang.com/archives/145/)*

## Commands to deploy a proper cAdvisor + Prometheus

1) Assume that you have run some containers which you want to monitor

2) Run cadvisor in a container

```bash
sudo docker run \
--volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
--volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
--volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
--volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
-p 8080:8080 \
--detach=true \
--name=cadvisor \
google/cadvisor:latest
```

3) Run Prometheus and set up a job about fetching metrics from cAdvisor

- First of all, we touch a new configure file

```xml
 ## prometheus.yml ##

 global:
     scrape_interval:     15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
     evaluation_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
         # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

         # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
         # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
     external_labels:
         monitor: 'blc-monitor'

 scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'prometheus'
       scrape_interval: 5s
       static_configs:
           - targets: ['localhost:9090']

     - job_name: 'cadvisor'
       # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
       scrape_interval: 5s
       static_configs:
           - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']
```

- Start Prometheus as container service, and link it to cadvisor

```bash
sudo docker run -d -p 9090:9090 \
-v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--link cadvisor:cadvisor \
--name=prometheus \
prom/prometheus \
--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Now you can use prometheus2csv to export your monitoring data, cheers!

## TODO

- Generate a config file for the first run: then you can update the query easily, and you can also choose some of the metrics you are interested in, instead of query all metrics.
- Multiple query jobs: maybe we need to query series of containers' monitoring data, so it's better to run prometheus2csv one time and get all the info you want (maybe with multiple csv files, classified by containers' names).
- For some metrics in Prometheus (acturally from cAdvisor), they have the same `__name__`, but some other labels' names differ. For example, you might get series of results for `container_fs_io_time_seconds_total`, because the container might have many `device` values. prometheus2csv should handle this circumstances.
